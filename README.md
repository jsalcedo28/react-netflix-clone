# react-netflix-clone
This is a clone of Netflix website built using React.JS as a Front-end &amp; Firebase as Back-end. It's not a replica, and it doesn't have all the features of Netflix website. it's a similar version of Netflix with my own design touch, showing my abilities in React.JS to build something advanced like Netflix. It contains the home page, sign-in page, sign-up page, browse page, and movie player.
